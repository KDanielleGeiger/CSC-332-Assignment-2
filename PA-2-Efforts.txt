# How to run the program?
Double-click the "PA-2-Executable.exe" file to run the program. The resulting spreadsheet will be created in the same directory as the executable (if it doesn't already exist). If it does exist, output will simply be appended to the existing spreadsheet. The executable was created on Windows 10 using PyInstaller (Python 3 pre-3.7).

# How was the spreadsheet generated?
The spreadsheet was generated by the program. A new entry is added to the spreadsheet each time the user sorts a new array.
